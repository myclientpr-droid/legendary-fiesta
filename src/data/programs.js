Through our Education for All program, we support refugee and marginalized children who are often left out of formal schooling. We create safe and supportive learning spaces where children can study, ask questions, and grow with confidence. Our focus is not only on subjects like language, science, and basic skills, but also on helping children believe in themselves and their future.',
